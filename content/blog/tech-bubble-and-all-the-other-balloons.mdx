I was born in a relatively religious culture as an introvert boy who has interest in computers. Also having the opportunity to have access to the computer at a small ago, it was amazed me to enter a new world which lets me be alone and also promising to turn into a career unlike art or music, at least in my own culture.
Somehow I convinced myself to be the person who I wanted to be if I managed to get successful at my career and it helped me to focus on my job probably more than average.
As a high school student who felt weird most of the time, it was "my thing" and I spent years during high school and college to build products, learn how to code and understand how compuers work. After spending some years and "believing on" myself, it became easy to convince other people about me being capabile of delivering value (sorry for the technie term here) so I managed to start a company, get fundraise, find customers, hire people during my career. All these challegneges were actually "convincing people" in a way and I guess thee healthy banalnce of convincing yourself and then confvinging other people makes you a successful person.

I gave a promise to myself that I won't give myself the confort zone until my 30s, this helped me to focus on what I do and not see the outside of my tiny world. My reasoning was that most people after their 30 have harder time to adopt and evolve and I knew that if I don't meet my expectations, I will be harder on myself in my 40s and that would make me a depressed person later on. Not sure how I got this ambition from and I don't think it's even healthy. I consider this as a "defect" as one of my friends call but it's also what makes "successful" people successful. I remember comparing myself to successful people in my age and being hard on myself all the time but I guess "being the person you want to be" often requires people to suffer to some extend. 

When I was 29, I sold my startup after working on it for 6 years. It was more an acqui-hire of a 4 people startup so it's not really a huge success. I was actually very depressed until the acqusition because you know, a 6 years old company is not considered as a startup anymore and I didn't know what should have done to grow the company at that point. It became more a lifetime business but abandoning the company still wouldn't make any sense as I would have to work harder at some other company and still make less money. On the other hand, I felt like I was running in a circle so not much personal "growth opportunity" was there for me for running the same business. I also didn't succeed at romantic relationships as I was very much focused at work so I was slowly failing at my 30 years old goal.

After the oppornity, I moved into a new city, London, and finally was able to have an healthier work and life balance so this helped me look at what I have done to myself over the last 10 years.
